# 🐶🐱 Cat vs Dog Image Classification

This is a deep learning project where I built a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images of cats and dogs using the popular **Dogs vs Cats** dataset from Kaggle.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how deep learning can be applied to image classification problems. The goal is to train a model that can accurately distinguish between cat and dog images. It includes:
- Dataset loading via Kaggle CLI
- Image preprocessing and augmentation
- CNN model creation using TensorFlow/Keras
- Model training and evaluation
- Accuracy visualization
